This action is equivalent to spellcasting with regard to the concentration it requires. The character can spend these Might points on any of the spirit’s powers.

He does not gain Magic Resistance from the use of this power, nor does he leave behind vis if he is slain. He cannot be affected by Vim spells (or similar magics) that target the Might score of supernatural creatures. Without a Might score, the pool does not replenish; once the character has spent all of his Might points this power ends. All powers used have their duration lapse when the character uses his last point of Might Pool. If this power is evoked again while the character still possesses Might Pool, then the new points gained replace the points left over; the two pools do not add.

This Virtue can only be bought if the character also has the Leprosy Flaw, and is only available to magi trained in House Tytalus. It allows him to draw upon the strength of his body to increase the power of his magic, granting the Life Boost Minor Virtue. He can also draw even deeper into this power if he desires, mortifying his disease-ridden flesh to produce vis to power his own spells. The vis generated in this way can only be used by the magus himself, in spellcasting or laboratory activities (but not study), and cannot be stored in any way — in fact, it never leaves his body. By accepting a Light Wound, the magus can infuse a single magical working with three pawns of vis, of any Technique or Form. A Medium Wound supplies six pawns, a Heavy Wound nine pawns, an Incapacitating Wound 12 pawns, and a Deadly Wound (killing the magus) 15 pawns. Any vis that is produced beyond the magus’s capacity to use in the current magical activity is lost, as is any vis surplus to the requirements of the activity to which this power is applied. Leprotic wounds open on the magus’s body as he calls upon this power, but not quickly enough to affect the Casting Total of a non-Ritual spell affected by this power. All Lab Totals suffer the wound penalty as normal, as do the Casting Totals of spells that take more than one round to cast (such as Ritual spells). The character makes no Recovery rolls for this wound until the magical activity that the vis is being used for is complete (i.e., at the end of the casting of the spell, or the end of a season for lab work). While this means that the wound cannot get better, it also means that it does not risk worsening. Since the power is expressed from the pain of this wound, magic used to negate that pain also negates the benefits of this Virtue. A wound taken in this fashion must heal completely before the power may be used again, and any character using this power more than three times a year must make an extra Aging roll in winter.</p>","source":"ArM5Def","page":0,"type":"hermetic","impact":{"value":"major"},"indexKey":"leper-magus","review_status":"reviewed","reviewer":"xzotl","hidden":false,"tainted":false},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.3.2.5","createdTime":1729619750991,"modifiedTime":1730470604262,"lastModifiedBy":"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J"},"folder":"ryEkrZYbf9tQGIrO","_id":"OVlDb1YRYo0fs9zt","sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J":3}}

Casting Items use the factors given in the Shape and Material Bonus table (page @@): each Casting Item provides one bonus. (If more than one bonus is possible, the spell design states which one is used.) </p><p> <strong>Potency Score = Sum of Bonus from each Casting Item </strong></p><p> <strong>Potency Bonus: Add Potency to Casting Score </strong></p><p> Potency is part of the spell design; a Lab Text for a Potent spell includes the specified Casting Items and Potency Score. A magus teaching a Potent spell teaches the formula he knows, including the Casting Items and Potency Score. The level, for the purposes of inventing it as well as for casting, of a Potent spell is unaltered by the Potency Score. However, a magus may not invent a Potent spell with a Potency higher than his Magic Theory score, even with the aid of a Lab Text or teacher. </p><p> Any magus can learn a Potent spell from a Lab Text or teacher, and apply Potency to his Casting Score; the Potent Magic Virtue is required to design a Potent spell from scratch, but not to reproduce one from a Lab Text. </p><p> To cast a Potent spell, the caster must touch the specified Casting Items. The items need not be large; they may be small and symbolic (for example, a shield-shaped brooch is still symbolically a shield). If the caster does not have the Casting Items available, the spell cannot be cast at all. </p><p> <em>Example: A wand provides several bonuses including +2 “repel things” and +4 “control things at a distance.” A Potent version of Disguise of the Putrid Aroma could use either bonus in its Potency. Combining it with magnetite (+3 Animal) allows a design with either Potency 5 (requires Magic Theory 5) or Potency 7 (requires Magic Theory 7). The caster must hold a wand and piece of magnetite (or a wand set with magnetite) to add the Potency to his Casting Score. </em></p><p> Potency applies only to Formulaic spells — Spontaneous Magic allows Ceremonial Casting to produce similar results, and enchanted devices use Shape and Material Bonuses during enchantment. </p><p> <strong>Potent Magic And Potent Spells </strong></p><p> A magus with Potent Magic may create new Potent spells or alter Potent spells to vary the Casting Items. </p><p> When inventing a spell within the field of his Potent Magic (including from a Lab Text), the magus simply chooses Casting Items for the design, and then invents the spell as normal. Each chosen Casting Item (up to the limit of Magic Theory) adds a single Shape or Material Bonus to Potency; if more than one bonus might apply to the spell, choose one and note it in the design. The total Potency may not exceed the magus’s Magic Theory. </p><p> A Lab Text written for this spell includes the Casting Items and Potency, and is usable by any other magus. </p><p> In addition, a magus who knows a spell within the field of his Potent Magic may invent a variant spell with different Casting Items (including a variant with no Casting Items). If the only difference is a change in Casting Items, he may invent the variant as if in possession of a Lab Text. If, for any reason, his current Lab Total is lower than the level of the spell, he may still invent the variant in a single season.</p><p> </p>","source":"ArM5Def","page":0,"type":"hermetic","impact":{"value":"minor"},"indexKey":"potent-magic-minor","review_status":"reviewed","reviewer":"xzotl","hidden":false,"tainted":false},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.3.2.5","createdTime":1729674679675,"modifiedTime":1730454399957,"lastModifiedBy":"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J"},"folder":"C8jqPqfblXk6hGCE","_id":"czW3ywbkvrK8X9TX","sort":3100000,"ownership":{"default":0,"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J":3}}

For example, a river, or canal, or lake, or sea is a water-way. Tributary streams of a river are the same water-way as the main river, but are <em>not </em>the same water-way as other tributaries to the main river. In some cases the troupe will need to decide precisely where one water-way begins, and another ends. </p><p> The magus must touch the water-way, when casting the spell, and the target must be either also touching the water-way or floating on it (in a boat, for example). A person on the bank of a river cannot be targeted by this spell.

The benefits of Potent Magic are compatible with a Magical Focus; unlike a Magical Focus, a maga may have more than one area of Potent Magic, although only one Potent Magic Virtue applies to any single activity. </p><p> Potent Magic provides the maga with a bonus in her field of magic, and permits her to devise Potent spells that gain a casting bonus from the sympathetic magic in shapes and materials. Potent Magic can be taught as an alternative to a Magical Focus. </p><p> Minor Potent Magic covers the same narrow fields as a Minor Magical Focus, and grants a +3 bonus to Lab Totals and Casting Score. </p><p> Major Potent Magic covers the same wide fields as a Major Magical Focus, and grants a +6 bonus to Lab Totals and Casting Score. </p><p> A maga with Potent Magic may also invent new Potent spells within the field of her Potent Magic, and may vary spells she knows.</p><p> <strong>Potent Spells </strong></p><p> A Potent spell has a bonus known as its Potency, which is arrived at by combining one or more Casting Items into the design of the spell. Casting Items use the factors given in the Shape and Material Bonus table (page @@): each Casting Item provides one bonus. (If more than one bonus is possible, the spell design states which one is used.) </p><p> <strong>Potency Score = Sum of Bonus from each Casting Item </strong></p><p> <strong>Potency Bonus: Add Potency to Casting Score </strong></p><p> Potency is part of the spell design; a Lab Text for a Potent spell includes the specified Casting Items and Potency Score. A magus teaching a Potent spell teaches the formula he knows, including the Casting Items and Potency Score. The level, for the purposes of inventing it as well as for casting, of a Potent spell is unaltered by the Potency Score. However, a magus may not invent a Potent spell with a Potency higher than his Magic Theory score, even with the aid of a Lab Text or teacher. </p><p> Any magus can learn a Potent spell from a Lab Text or teacher, and apply Potency to his Casting Score; the Potent Magic Virtue is required to design a Potent spell from scratch, but not to reproduce one from a Lab Text. </p><p> To cast a Potent spell, the caster must touch the specified Casting Items. The items need not be large; they may be small and symbolic (for example, a shield-shaped brooch is still symbolically a shield). If the caster does not have the Casting Items available, the spell cannot be cast at all. </p><p> <em>Example: A wand provides several bonuses including +2 “repel things” and +4 “control things at a distance.” A Potent version of Disguise of the Putrid Aroma could use either bonus in its Potency. Combining it with magnetite (+3 Animal) allows a design with either Potency 5 (requires Magic Theory 5) or Potency 7 (requires Magic Theory 7). The caster must hold a wand and piece of magnetite (or a wand set with magnetite) to add the Potency to his Casting Score. </em></p><p> Potency applies only to Formulaic spells — Spontaneous Magic allows Ceremonial Casting to produce similar results, and enchanted devices use Shape and Material Bonuses during enchantment. </p><p> <strong>Potent Magic And Potent Spells </strong></p><p> A magus with Potent Magic may create new Potent spells or alter Potent spells to vary the Casting Items. </p><p> When inventing a spell within the field of his Potent Magic (including from a Lab Text), the magus simply chooses Casting Items for the design, and then invents the spell as normal. Each chosen Casting Item (up to the limit of Magic Theory) adds a single Shape or Material Bonus to Potency; if more than one bonus might apply to the spell, choose one and note it in the design. The total Potency may not exceed the magus’s Magic Theory. </p><p> A Lab Text written for this spell includes the Casting Items and Potency, and is usable by any other magus. </p><p> In addition, a magus who knows a spell within the field of his Potent Magic may invent a variant spell with different Casting Items (including a variant with no Casting Items). If the only difference is a change in Casting Items, he may invent the variant as if in possession of a Lab Text. If, for any reason, his current Lab Total is lower than the level of the spell, he may still invent the variant in a single season.</p><p> </p>","source":"ArM5Def","page":0,"type":"hermetic","impact":{"value":"major"},"indexKey":"potent-magic-major","review_status":"reviewed","reviewer":"xzotl","hidden":false,"tainted":false},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.3.2.5","createdTime":1729674705556,"modifiedTime":1730453944437,"lastModifiedBy":"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J"},"folder":"ryEkrZYbf9tQGIrO","_id":"iIIsjkAOCdkrABVO","sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J":3}}

You may choose any Craft, Profession, or other Ability with a clear verbal or physical practice. You may not choose any Language, Supernatural, Academic, or Arcane Ability. </p><p> There are distinct Virtues for each possible Ability, as each allows different methods to work its actions into magic: knowing one method of Performance Magic does not let the magus use any other Ability in magic. </p><p> It is the action or words of the practice that are the focus of this Virtue, not the products of craft-working. An Ability that is <em>verbal </em>(such as storytelling) replaces the words of spellcasting; similarly, an Ability that is <em>physical </em>(such as hunting) replaces gestures. An Ability that encompasses both verbal and physical aspects (such as music, or mumming (acting)) allows the performer more flexibility. </p><p> The magus must actually perform the Ability to count as using this Virtue, and other Virtues or Mastery Abilities do not remove that requirement. For example, he cannot sing silently, although he <em>can </em>hunt silently. </p><p> Words or gestures that are not being replaced by Performance Magic remain as normal mystical components of spell-casting: use the normal rules and adjustments (including Virtues such as Quiet Magic and Mastery Abilities such as Still Casting). </p><p> <em>Example: Orlando is a musician and magus, and knows Sorcerous Music and Subtle Magic. He may cast spells while he sings (with no penalty for no gestures), plays his lute, or sings and plays. If he sings or plays quietly, he suffers the normal –5 penalty. He can cast spells silently, but only by not using Sorcerous Music. </em></p><p> <em>His friend Furioso, another Sorcerous Musician, lacks Subtle Magic. If he has no instrument with him, then, unlike Orlando, he must use normal Hermetic gestures or suffer the penalty for no gestures. </em></p><p> The magus may choose to vocalize loudly, or move exaggeratedly, and gain the equivalent bonuses as for loud words or exaggerated gestures. Bystanders may notice this as unusual activity, and take interest where they might not otherwise. </p><p> <strong>New Duration</strong>: <strong>Performance. </strong>The spell lasts as long as the caster performs the Performance Ability. Performance is equivalent to Concentration Duration. </p><p> To cast a Performance Duration spell, the magus must succeed in a roll (simple or stress die, according to circumstances) of Characteristic (varies with Ability) + Ability against an Ease Factor of 3. </p><p> The spell fails if this fails, and botches if the roll botches. The spell ends when the magus ceases to perform the Ability, but no Concentration or Ability rolls are needed to maintain the spell while the performance continues. </p><p> Formulaic spells must be devised with the new Duration to use this Ability; if so designed, the spell cannot be cast without performing. </p><p> <em>Example: Harold knows Performance Magic (Hunt), casts </em>Hunter’s Tracks of the Faerie Glow <em>(a variant of </em>Tracks of the Faerie Glow<em>), and succeeds with his simple Hunt roll. His magically enhanced vision persists as long as he keeps up the hunt, even if he is distracted by chatter or other spellcasting. </em></p><p> <em>Example: Orlando sings while he casts a </em>Sung Lamp Without Flame<em>. The light continues while he continues to sing, however badly, but ends when he stops singing.
