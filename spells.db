As with conjuring the foundations, this ritual requires an Int + Finesse stress roll against an Ease Factor of 12. A failed Finesse roll creates a section of tower of shoddy quality, while a successful roll creates a standard quality section. Botch dice on this Finesse roll are equal to 1 + 1 for each other level where the magus failed to meet the Finesse roll (failures should be recorded for future reference). This represents the inherent complexities and dangers of the project.\nBotches on this roll should be handled as story events, but clearly a botch in creating and assembling several thousand tons of stone is going to be significant. As the tower grows, the complexity of controlling the magic also grows, as does the risk of disaster, which may act as a limiting factor on the number of levels a magus would feel safe in conjuring.\nNote that by increasing the level of this spell by one magnitude, 40 levels of the tower could be produced, and 400 levels could be produced by increasing the spell by two magnitudes. But doing so should have a direct impact on the number of botch dice for the required Finesse roll. For each additional magnitude of size, add +3 to both the botch dice and the Finesse roll Ease Factor.\nCasting this spell creates a preternatural tether of 1 and adds +1 to the aura variation modifier.","source":"HP","page":40,"indexKey":"heights-of-the-great-tower","enhancingRequisite":0,"general":false,"levelOffset":0,"baseEffectDescription":"","applyFocus":false,"bonus":0,"bonusDesc":"","xp":0,"masteryAbilities":"","review_status":"toReview","reviewer":"","ownership":null},"img":"systems/arm5e/assets/magic/te.png","effects":[],"flags":{},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.3.2.5","createdTime":1730266623057,"modifiedTime":1730266623057,"lastModifiedBy":"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J"},"_id":"04KdszwF3pA2WpBs","folder":"Cy6JvysNx2CNSwuF","sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J":3}}

Furthermore, spells that bring objects into the Aegis, including teleportation spells such as The Seven-League Stride, are also resisted unless the caster was involved in the ritual. If the foreign spell cannot penetrate a resistance equal to the level of the Aegis, it fizzles out. The Aegis is also able to block foreign Intellego spells, even if they cannot normally be blocked by a Parma Magica, and spells that were cast before they entered the Aegis, such as an invisibility spell cast on a magus outside the Aegis.\nMagi who were not involved in the ritual and who cast spells within the Aegis must subtract half the level of the Aegis from all their Casting Totals. Spells successfully cast have otherwise normal effects (e.g. Ignem spells still do full damage). Penetration totals for magical creatures are reduced by the same amount.\nEffects from enchanted devices are resisted by the Aegis unless the item was within the Aegis at the time of casting, or was created within the Aegis by someone who was part of the ritual or in possession of a token.\nCreatures with a Might score cannot enter the area protected by the Aegis unless they have a higher Might than the Aegis s level. When approaching the border of an Aegis, a magical person (including a Hermetic magus) feels a slight tingle in the extremities. Magical, Infernal, Faerie, and Divine creatures and persons may be brought.\nSuch a person is also not affected by the penalty to casting within the Aegis. The invitation may be withdrawn at any time. This does not require retrieving the token or even notifying the individual who is no longer welcome. Withdrawing an invitation will not expel the person beyond the Aegis, but will prevent them from re-entering after they leave (unless their Might is high enough), and subject them to the Casting Total penalty while they are within the Aegis. The invitation and expulsion must both be issued by magi who participated in the ritual, but not necessarily by the same magus. A magus may only invite or expel specific, known, individuals. He may not expel someone he does not know has been invited in.\nThe Aegis is typically cast on the winter solstice, since magical auras can be slightly higher at that time, and the Aegis then lasts for the entire next year. The entire covenant usually participates in the Aegis ritual, which often ends with the participants walking around the perimeter of the protected area in order to define it. Quite often, the covenant holds a major council meeting, or perhaps a large feast, after the ritual of the Aegis. Magi do not need to be able to cast the spell to participate in the ritual, and, indeed, non-Hermetic wizards can participate as well. Only one magus needs to actually cast the spell.\nAegis of the Hearth was invented by Notatus, the first Primus of House Bonisagus. It was a major breakthrough, incorporating Mercurian rituals as well as Hermetic theory, and was the reason Notatus was chosen to succeed Bonisagus. As a result, the spell is more powerful than it ought to be, and has no Perdo requisite. By 1220 Notatus’s discoveries have spread, and any magus trained in the Order is capable of inventing versions of the Aegis with the above parameters, but at different levels. Inventing a version with different parameters, however, would require a similar breakthrough, and years of research.","source":"ArM5","page":161,"indexKey":"aegis-of-the-hearth","targetSize":0,"enhancingRequisite":0,"general":false,"levelOffset":0,"baseEffectDescription":"","applyFocus":false,"bonus":0,"bonusDesc":"","xp":0,"masteryAbilities":"","review_status":"toReview","reviewer":"","ownership":null},"img":"systems/arm5e/assets/magic/vi.png","effects":[],"flags":{},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.3.2.5","createdTime":1730266633698,"modifiedTime":1730266633698,"lastModifiedBy":"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J"},"_id":"4w2zrWwtwJGYsdfk","folder":"FLOveJlX4MXFkepb","sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J":3}}

Some casting requisites are usually required, depending on the composition of the lab’s outfittings; a Herbam requisite is required to move wooden furniture, an Aquam requisite is required to move liquids, and so on. The destination room must be at least as large as the occupied part of the current room, although it can be a different shape. Magi quite often utilize this effect in order to avoid the tiresome (and expensive) practicalities of moving their sanctum by more mundane means. When this spell is cast on a lab, make a Perception + Finesse roll to determine the precision with which the contents are rearranged in the new chamber. The base Ease Factor is 9 + (3 x Refinement). Add three if the lab is Highly Organized; subtract three if it is Disorganized. Also add three if the shapes of the old and new chambers do not match, or six if they are radically different.

The foundations extend deep into the earth, forming cellars, crypts, and cisterns between the immense stone pillars driven into the ground.\nThe time taken to develop this ritual is spent not only in learning how to draw the complex magical forces together, but also in designing the foundations and the lowest levels of the tower, which are filled with rooms, cloisters, courtyards, and arcades.\nCreo magic that creates artificial things, such as this huge tower, requires an Int + Finesse stress roll against an Ease Factor, in this case, of 12. If the roll fails, the tower is still successfully conjured but may require additional work to improve its appearance or to repair defects introduced by the casting. A failed Finesse roll creates a section of tower of shoddy quality, while a successful roll creates a standard quality section. If the Finesse roll botches, the foundations are not strong enough to support the tower and a stress check against damage is required each year.\nThe +7 magnitudes for size creates a circular tower of two levels, 2,000 feet in diameter, standing 40 feet above ground level. The high modifier for the elaborate design is required for the precise placement of the foundations, a hugely important factor in a tower this large.\nCasting this ritual causes a +1 preternatural tether, as per Realms of Power: Magic, page 10.

It has no effect if the target is already bound as a familiar to another.\nCasting requisites of a Technique and Form appropriate to the creature’s nature and physical form may be included. These two Arts are used to determine the Lab Total for any subsequent improvements to the bond. The cords connecting maga and familiar have initial values of 0, and the vis cost of this ritual does not apply towards these improvements. The maga can strengthen the bond in the lab, but the effect is still inherently temporary. If she casts this on a faerie, she gains the three special powers (Shared Powers, Shared Senses, and Shared Fatigue) associated with a faerie familiar, but the cords will decay as normal, though the bond is never completely broken so long as the spell’s duration remains in effect.\nBecause the bond is often made under duress, the familiar is much more wild and independent than normal familiars, and typically must be subdued or guarded to ensure it does not try to escape. The two are probably at odds most of the time, and the faerie is likely to bear a grudge against the maga afterward if it is taken advantage of or treated badly.","source":"HoH:MC","page":90,"indexKey":"faerie-chains-of-the-familiar-slave","targetSize":0,"enhancingRequisite":0,"general":false,"levelOffset":0,"baseEffectDescription":"","applyFocus":false,"bonus":0,"bonusDesc":"","xp":0,"masteryAbilities":"","review_status":"toReview","reviewer":"","ownership":null},"img":"systems/arm5e/assets/magic/vi.png","effects":[],"flags":{},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.3.2.5","createdTime":1730266633698,"modifiedTime":1730266633698,"lastModifiedBy":"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J"},"_id":"I06AokCZo32idmhg","folder":"FLOveJlX4MXFkepb","sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J":3}}

This proved not to be the case. William Bonisagi theorized that the species, recreated as they are, bear insufficient connection to the things they represent to support casting spells against them. By being so far removed, the magus would essentially be attempting to cast his spells on mere apparitions.\nHowever, using this spell to aid with Hermetic Geometry spells (those using Arcane Line, Arcane Circle, and Arcane Ring) reduces the Distance Level by 1 if the caster can now see his target. This is cumulative with other spells or devices that may also reduce the Distance Level (see The Worldly Halysis later).\nThe Target is based on Room, but is more complex as it allows unbounded spaces to be targeted.

After a year under the effects of this spell, each covenfolk affected will therefore have a Warping Score of 1, and acquire either the Simple-Minded or Short Attention Span Flaw as his first Minor Flaw.","source":"Cov","page":41,"indexKey":"instant-loyalty-of-the-rebellious-turb","enhancingRequisite":0,"general":false,"levelOffset":0,"baseEffectDescription":"","applyFocus":false,"bonus":0,"bonusDesc":"","xp":0,"masteryAbilities":"","review_status":"toReview","reviewer":"","ownership":null},"img":"systems/arm5e/assets/magic/me.png","effects":[],"flags":{},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.3.2.5","createdTime":1730266602531,"modifiedTime":1730266602531,"lastModifiedBy":"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J"},"_id":"NnOFztwYHx6zmUtb","folder":"A2fOZ4LIRFoc2Ij8","sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J":3}}

If the whole structure cannot be perfected, the magus can usually perfect individual rooms using Perfection of the Well- Designed Chamber.\nA building so perfected counts for the Ceremonial bonus options of Hermetic Geometry. It is also stronger and more stable against tremors and storms, and has a pleasing air to those beholding it, or living and working within. The magical perfection is momentary, and then slowly fades as the building structure decays naturally over time; for Ceremonial purposes most buildings remain perfected for a day or so before they settle slightly and lapse.\nIf there is doubt about the limits of perfection, a Perception + Artes Liberales (geometry) roll against an Ease Factor of 12 or higher resolves the issue. (Difficulty depends upon the irregularities that need perfecting, however, if the Ease Factor would be less than 12 (Hard) the spell will perfect the target without guidance.) The Mystery of Hermetic Architecture teaches how to enchant this effect into a building so that the enchantment sustains the perfection indefinitely.","source":"TMRE","page":96,"indexKey":"the-perfected-structure","targetSize":0,"general":false,"levelOffset":0,"baseEffectDescription":"","applyFocus":false,"bonus":0,"bonusDesc":"","xp":0,"masteryAbilities":"","review_status":"toReview","reviewer":"","ownership":null},"img":"systems/arm5e/assets/magic/te.png","effects":[],"flags":{},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.3.2.5","createdTime":1730266623057,"modifiedTime":1730266623057,"lastModifiedBy":"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J"},"_id":"QYxjrE7W95lrmjaB","folder":"Cy6JvysNx2CNSwuF","sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J":3}}

It requires the immobilized body of the recipient animal, and the donor organ. If the donor derives from another animal, it too must be immobilized. During the casting of the spell, the caster removes the organ from the donor and grafts it to the recipient. The spell resizes the organ (if necessary) and joins up the blood supply and internal organs. The type of organs that can be transplanted are functional units of the animal — its head, pair of hind legs, tail, pair of hands, heart, and so forth. A replacement organ involves the removal of the recipient’s organ and putting the donor organ in its place. If the caster wishes he may take the recipient’s original organ and put it in the space left on the donor, but this requires two surgical rolls (see below), one for each animal. A transposed organ involves the recipient gaining an organ without removing something first; for example, giving it a pair of wings or a second head. The donor animal (if any) dies as a result of this type of surgery. Magical surgery of this type can be purely anatomical, or else confer a Virtue from the donor to the recipient. An anatomical change can grant the recipient a new ability (such as flight) or a Quality (see Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, pages 40-43). A Virtue can be any General Virtue that derives from the body of the animal; such as Keen Vision, Long-Winded, or Tough. A donor who loses a Virtue due to this spell receives the Enfeebled Flaw if it survives the surgery. The ritual surgery performed as part of the magical actions of casting this spell needs to be performed accurately to ensure the success of the spell. This requires a Dexterity + Chirurgy roll against an Ease Factor of 9. If the organ is transposed rather than replaced, the Ease Factor has a +3 modifier. If the surgery grants a Virtue rather than an anatomical change, the Ease Factor has an additional +3 modifier. If the surgery roll fails then the animal dies soon after the casting of the spell. If the surgery roll botches, then the spell creates some dreadful monster instead.\nExample: Marcus wishes to swap the head of a lion and an eagle in his first step to creating a griffin. Eagles have the Keen Vision Virtue, so this is more than simple anatomical surgery. To successfully implant the eagle’s head on the lion s body, his surgery roll has an Ease Factor of 12. He needs only a 9 to successfully implant the lion s head on the eagle s body, but the lion-headed eagle that results suffers from the Enfeebled Flaw. The spell compensates for the vast difference in size between the two heads.","source":"MoH","page":83,"indexKey":"harmonic-metamorphosis-of-the-beast","targetSize":0,"general":false,"levelOffset":0,"baseEffectDescription":"","applyFocus":false,"bonus":0,"bonusDesc":"","xp":0,"masteryAbilities":"","review_status":"reviewed","reviewer":"TGGoHS"},"img":"systems/arm5e/assets/magic/an.png","effects":[],"flags":{},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":"Compendium.world.spells-animal.Item.RCHM4ybwN9LF76LZ","duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.3.2.3","createdTime":1729689989096,"modifiedTime":1729689989096,"lastModifiedBy":"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J"},"_id":"RCHM4ybwN9LF76LZ","ownership":{"default":0,"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J":3},"folder":"Wzb8TRtvqtVwjohA","sort":0}

On subsequent rounds, the wielder hangs on by making Strength stress rolls of 6+, allowed once per round. If a roll to hold on ever botches, the wielder loses control of the weapon and is hit by it automatically (see below). While still in its wielder’s grip, the weapon does not strike him or her, but does not strike on the wielder’s behalf either. Once the weapon breaks free or is released, it attacks its wielder, using his Attack and Damage scores. The former wielder may fight the rebellious weapon. The weapon uses its defense rating as its Defense total. It has no Soak, and is “killed” after it takes a wound depending on its size. One-handed weapons must take a Medium Wound, while two- handed weapons must take a Heavy Wound.

The caster decides the kind of music he wishes to hear (a ballad, a whirly jig, etc.), and the spell accommodates. The music of the flames always incorporates a signature refrain, as though a sigil, with each casting. But the mood of that same refrain is adapted to the needs of the song.\nThe flames play the same music all the while the fire burns, getting louder as the fire burns brighter, hotter, or larger, though the random nature of fire and differences in fuel mean that no two castings ever produce exactly the same performance.\nThe spell ends when the flame is extinguished, its original source is fully destroyed or, for particularly long- burning fires, when the spell’s Sun Duration naturally expires. This spell cannot affect a fire that is already larger than a campfire or a fire in a hearth (essentially, any fire doing +5 damage), but a fire that grows larger than this retains the magic.\nYestin originally designed this spell so that his fire, whether on the road or in his sanctum, could gently sing him to sleep. But the more he explored this new spell, the more he found new uses for it. It wasn’t just music that the flames could produce, but also speech (though limited in the range of words and voice to little more than those the caster imagines as he casts the spell) or other natural and unnatural sounds. These sounds always adopt the rhythm of the spell’s original melody, though. If left to sing (or talk) of its own volition, with no guidance from the caster, the fire sounds as though it is forming words, but this is an illusion; the sounds form true words by accident if at all.\nYestin has used this spell in his sanctum to experiment with different harmonies, and has on occasion established choirs of candles each quietly singing a different refrain or a different note. The effect can be mesmerizing.\nA Finesse Stress roll (Mastery of the spell reduces this to a simple roll) determines how pleasant the sound is, but the size of the fire determines how loud it is.

The conflagrative servant is insubstantial but cannot pass through solid objects. The insubstantial nature of the servant also normally prevents it from manipulating objects.

The conflagrative servant has no Abilities. The conflagrative servant is subject to damage from Perdo Ignem spells and water. When the conflagrative servant is injured by these means, it shrinks in size. Every size category that the conflagrative servant shrinks, it loses 2 points from its Strength and Stamina scores and gains 1 point in its Dexterity and Quickness scores. The conflagrative servant is extinguished if it shrinks to smaller than a candle flame in size (Size -10). Ranulf frequently casts Flames of Stone upon his conflagrative servants in order to allow them to perform manual labor. This makes the conflagrative servant substantial and vulnerable to physical damage. Any damage done to the conflagrative servant causes it to shrink as detailed above. A Light Wound shrinks the servant one size level, a Medium Wound shrinks the servant two size levels, and so on.

Even fires created by mundane or magical means appear weak, and only dimly lit. Plants within the Boundary turn to leafless caricatures of life sooner or later. Note that a Boundary requires a well- defined border, such as the tree line of a grove, the cliffs of a steep valley, or the shore of an island.\nA brief note on the specific use of this spell that should not to be mistaken for traits or side-effects of the spell itself: The area affected by Domain of Darkness provides a haven for all creatures that shun the light. It represents Tolides’ latest attempt to establish some sort of abode in a domain of his own. Because the affected Boundary is inhabited by a practicing diabolist, and the ritual needed to cast the spell is often powered by Infernal vis, the aura of the Boundary slowly but steadily accumulates more and more traits of Infernal Warping. For example, animals that stay inside the domain for an extended period of time are likely to turn into Corrupted Beasts — repellent aberrations of nature {Realms of Power: The Infernal, page 77). One day, the affected Boundary might even become a regio of its own, which is exactly what Tolides has planned.","source":"MoH","page":133,"indexKey":"domain-of-darkness","enhancingRequisite":0,"general":false,"levelOffset":0,"baseEffectDescription":"","applyFocus":false,"bonus":0,"bonusDesc":"","xp":0,"masteryAbilities":"","review_status":"toReview","reviewer":"","ownership":null},"img":"systems/arm5e/assets/magic/ig.png","effects":[],"flags":{},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.3.2.5","createdTime":1730266564295,"modifiedTime":1730266564295,"lastModifiedBy":"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J"},"_id":"VbViYYJjjI75BBMH","folder":"TXWRpVwDyXc4LXyP","sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J":3}}

Remember to count Defense bonuses because of shields.\nThis spell requires that the caster has large collection of sharp glass shards, which need to be mundane in order to bypass Magic Resistance in this way. The shards could be created using a momentary Creo Terram ritual (such as The Shattered Goblet), or they could be acquired from a mundane craftsman, although this is probably more expensive and inconvenient for most magi.

The target of the Watching Ward must be present for the entire casting ritual. When the conditions you specify come to pass, the suspended spell takes effect.\nOnly one Watching Ward can be placed on any one person or object. The level of the Watching Ward must at least equal the level of the spell held in suspension. You can put multiple spells in the Ward, provided that its level at least equals the sum of the levels of the contained spells. If Intellego spells are included in a Watching Ward, they may be used to trigger the other spells. Thus, if you put Frosty Breath of the Spoken Lie (InMe 20) into the Watching Ward, you can also put in a spell that is cast when someone lies. An Intellego spell in the Watching Ward has no effect other than to cast other spells when the proper condition is detected. Thus, in the example, one’s breath is not frosty when he or she is caught in a lie.\nIf someone tries to dispel the Watching Ward and fails, the suspended spell is cast. Flambeau and Tytalus magi commonly put highly destructive spells upon their persons, to be cast if they die so they may have vengeance upon their killers. The Ritual nature of this spell supports the potentially indefinite duration.\nThe Watching Ward is dispelled when it releases its spell. A version of this spell with target Room, known as Waiting Spell, is also well known in the Order.

The affected fires all take on a slightly unnatural appearance as their flames move into a configuration that does not completely match the logs that they are burning, and they are altered by the sigil of the casting wizard.\nWhen Ranulfs apprentice is away from him, the apprentice is instructed to kindle a fire using a coal stored in the Chest of the Ember Seed just after sunset every evening. While this spell is normally intended to unite two fires, the spell was designed with a Target of Group. Ranulf believed that the effort required to create a spell that affected just two fires would be as great as or greater than the work needed to develop a spell that targeted a group, because of the difficulty of using non-standard Targets. As a result, more than two fires can be affected by this spell, and the caster could be completely unaware of the additional fires (possibly allowing a communication to be intercepted, see Discourse of Glowing Tongues above).\nThis spell is an example of magic created to match the needs of the magus. For most magi, any number of Intellego spells would provide a significantly easier method of communication.

The group of magi work together to cast a specified spell through the unified power of the Communion. Only one extra magus may join the Communion for each 5 levels of the specified spell being cast. One of the magi in the group must also know the specified spell, or cast it from a Casting Tablet.\nOnly one magus in the group needs to cast the spell. The magus who casts the Wizard's Communion need not be the one who casts the main spell, and normally it is better for them to be different. More than one magus in the group may cast the spell. In this case, add the total levels of successfully cast Wizard's Communion to get the effective level of the Wizard's Communion for this casting.  This combined total must be at least twice the level of the specified spell being cast.\nOne magus must roll for success as if casting the specified spell himself. However, the target number for the spellcasting roll is the spell’s level divided by the number of magi participating in the Communion.

The spell can be cast on any group of people, and can project any sort of visual mark, so Tremere magi also use it for processions and sport. Any Awareness roll concerning the location of forces has a +3 bonus while this spell is in effect. Examples include selecting areas of the battlefield to target with destructive spells, selecting victims for missile fire, finding groups to rally to when separated from the army in the swirl of battle.\nThis version of the spell is able to mark up to a thousand individuals, in groups within the magus’s Sight. Some younger magi prefer a version of the spell suited for smaller units of grogs. This version is level 25, is effective to Voice range, and can only affect a group of about ten.

This spell is suitable for producing a cotte, cyclas, ganache, bliaut, cappa, or chausses (see the Clothing of the Thirteenth Century insert). A Finesse roll is necessary to determine the success of the craft magic; the Ease Factor is 12 if raw fleece is employed, or 9 if the base material is spun wool. The clothes produced are of standard quality; increase the Ease Factor for particularly fine or complex craft. If the Finesse roll fails, the caster is left with a useless mess of wool. Creating a fabric of a different color than the raw material requires a supply of appropriate dye, but does not change the Ease Factor. Julia typically uses this spell to manufacture clothes out of the magical cloth that she makes (see Enchanted Items, later). She does not have a spell that directly creates mundane clothing of wool due to the difficulty (it would be a similar spell to Sturdy Mantle of the Traveler, earlier). Instead, it is much easier to simply create fleeces (see Shearing the Unseen Flock, later) and then craft them into clothing with this spell.

Small ships, up to size +5, can ordinarily be built in a single season, while larger ships take multiple seasons. The following table takes this into account and provides a guide to Craft Magic Ease Factors for creating vessels of different sizes: [TABLE] .\nIn the table earlier, building a river barge is a relatively easy task for a shipwright, which is a base Ease Factor of 9, but the construction is likely to take up to a season, which adds +6 to the Ease Factor for a total of 15. Building a Mediterranean grain barge is an impressive feat (Ease Factor 21) and would normally take a shipwright a year (+9), which means a magus faces an Ease Factor of 30 to create such a vessel with craft magic.

The defender may add Athletics to their roll if they are braced for the attack. If the caster’s roll exceeds her opponent’s, then the target is knocked off his feet and flung backwards one foot for every point of the difference. As a violent storm wind, the target is instead flung three feet per point of the difference. Falling damage (Ars Magica Fifth Edition page 181) is inflicted on those knocked over; hitting an obstruction before the full distance flung back is reached counts as falling onto a hard surface (such as a wall) or a soft surface (such as a haystack).

All the magi in the group must add together the (level-2 magnitudes) of the Day of Communion they are casting. This number must exceed twice the level of the specified ritual being cast. As no more than one magus may join the group for each magnitude of the ritual being cast, this means that this spell is largely useless below level 20. It is highly useful for casting an efficient Aegis of the Hearth, which is no exception to the rule that all spells directly affecting targets must Penetrate.","source":"Through the Aegis","page":137,"indexKey":"day-of-communion","targetSize":0,"enhancingRequisite":0,"general":false,"levelOffset":0,"baseEffectDescription":"","applyFocus":false,"bonus":0,"bonusDesc":"","xp":0,"masteryAbilities":"","review_status":"toReview","reviewer":"","ownership":null},"img":"systems/arm5e/assets/magic/vi.png","effects":[],"flags":{},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.3.2.5","createdTime":1730266633698,"modifiedTime":1730266633698,"lastModifiedBy":"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J"},"_id":"yZjUDGz6lcwxUbE6","folder":"FLOveJlX4MXFkepb","sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J":3}}

If you are trying to get a specific fact, you need a Perception + Finesse stress roll against an Ease Factor of 6, or 12 if the fact is obscure. Since normal animals are sensitive to magic, they resist your touch and try to shy away from you both when the spell is cast and while the spell continues to function. This can be quite a problem with larger animals.</p>","source":"ArM5Def","page":0,"indexKey":"opening-the-tome-of-the-animals-mind","targetSize":0,"enhancingRequisite":0,"general":false,"levelOffset":0,"baseEffectDescription":"","applyFocus":false,"bonus":0,"bonusDesc":"","xp":0,"masteryAbilities":"","review_status":"reviewed","reviewer":"Yves Stadler"},"img":"systems/arm5e/assets/magic/an.png","effects":[],"flags":{},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":"Compendium.world.spells-animal.Item.zC6bF59K7RFhNq1c","duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.3.2.3","createdTime":1729689989096,"modifiedTime":1729689989096,"lastModifiedBy":"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J"},"_id":"zC6bF59K7RFhNq1c","ownership":{"default":0,"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J":3},"folder":"Wzb8TRtvqtVwjohA","sort":0}

Secrets kept for noble reasons are not affected by this spell, which was a conscious design decision made by Yestin. This spell does not make the target susceptible to questioning on other matters, and so cannot be used to assist directed interrogation.\nAt the end of the spell’s duration, the target must make a personality roll against an Ease Factor of 6. If the target succeeds, she maintains control over her secret and keeps it hidden. The troupe should agree which Personality trait the target uses in the roll.\nFor each subsequent day that the spell is cast on the target, the Ease Factor increases by 1. Virtues and Flaws may modify the roll and/or the Ease Factor, with the Storyguide’s agreement.\nIf the personality check fails, the target falls prey to his conscience and seeks someone to confide in. That person may not necessarily be the caster of the spell, and will most likely be someone the target feels he can trust. The Infernal and the Dominion have a strong impact on this spell, dealing as they do with the moral aspects of human life. If the target spends time in the Dominion, the light of the Lord helps to release the truth and the level of the aura is subtracted from the target’s roll. The aura’s Temper (see Realms of Power: The Divine, page 38) also has an effect with Brave, Wise, Strong, or Just Tempers, increasing the aura’s effect by 1.\nIf the target spends the duration of the spell within an Infernal aura, the corrupting influence of the aura reinforces the target’s resolve to keep the secret. The level of the aura is added to the target’s roll. The Storyguide may impose a further bonus to the roll based on any Tarnish or Corruption of the Infernal aura (see Realms of Power: The Infernal, page 13).\nYestin invented this spell as a means to more easily solve those mysteries that the spirit Taliesin led him into; mysteries often solved by knowing what those involved wished to hide.","source":"MoH","page":141,"indexKey":"lay-your-burdens-on-me","targetSize":0,"enhancingRequisite":0,"general":false,"levelOffset":0,"baseEffectDescription":"","applyFocus":false,"bonus":0,"bonusDesc":"","xp":0,"masteryAbilities":"","review_status":"toReview","reviewer":"","ownership":null},"img":"systems/arm5e/assets/magic/me.png","effects":[],"flags":{},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"arm5e","systemVersion":"2.3.2.5","createdTime":1730266602531,"modifiedTime":1730266602531,"lastModifiedBy":"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J"},"_id":"zLfzDYLwfQ3dN2KF","folder":"A2fOZ4LIRFoc2Ij8","sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"6SdI10VpXHcBvx2J":3}}
